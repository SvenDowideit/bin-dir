# My bin-dir

Its full of stuff from my time working on RancherOS, but now I'm also using it to
setup my desktop.

To start from a new Ubuntu/Debian, run:

```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenDowideit/bin-dir/master/desktop-setup.sh | bash
```

This should be idemoptent - and should allow things to be auto-upgraded...
